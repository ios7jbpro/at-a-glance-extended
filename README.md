# Info
This is a complete open project to replicate the Google's At A Glance but with a better way with more options to customize. You can edit it however you want.
Just ask permission from me(Telegram: @ios7jbpro), and you can make your own releases based on this project. This is why I call it "open";). Soon in next
releases I'll add an explanation for every option and what it does for anyone who wants to modify.
